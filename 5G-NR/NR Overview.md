Compared to LTE, NR provides many benefits. Some of the main ones are:
- Exploitation of much higher-frequency bands as a mean to obtain additional spectra to support very wide transmission bandwidths and the associated high data rates;
- Ultra-lean design to enhance network energy performance and reduce interference;
- Forward compatibility to prepare for future, yet unknown, use cases and technologies;
- Low latency to improve performance and enable new use cases;
- A beam-centric design enabling extensive usage of beamforming and a massive number of antenna elements not only for data transmission (which to some extent is possible in LTE) but also for control-plane procedures such as
initial access.
