# Overview of Standardization and Regulation
**Three groups:** 

_Standards Developing Organizations(SDOs)_: SDOs are usually nonprofit industry organizations and not government controlled. e.g., 3GPP.

_regulatory bodies and administrations_: government-led organizations, control spectrum use, regulate “placing on the market” of products. e.g., ITU.

_industry forums_: industry-led groups promoting and lobbying for specific technologies or other interests. e.g., GSMA(GSM Association).

_Dashed arrows show more indirect involvement through, for example, liaison statements and white papers._
# ITU-R Activities Frm 3G to 5G
ITU-R is responsible for ensuring efficient and economical use of the RF spectrum by all radio communication services.
> “ensure interference-free operations of radio communication systems,”

Within ITU-R, it is Working Party 5D (WP5D) that has the responsibility for the overall radio system aspects of IMT systems.

WP5D has the prime responsibility within ITU-R for issues related to the terrestrial component of IMT, including technical, operational, and spectrum-related issues.

WP5D does not create the actual technical specifications for IMT, but has kept the roles of defining IMT in cooperation with the regional standardization bodies and maintaining a set of recommendations and reports for IMT, including a set of Radio Interface Specifications (RSPCs).

The following RSPC recommendations are in existence or planned:

• For IMT-2000: ITU-R Recommendation M.1457 containing six different RITs including the 3G technologies such as WCDMA/HSPA.

• For IMT-Advanced: ITU-R Recommendation M.2012 containing two different RITs where the most important is 4G/LTE.

• For IMT-2020: A new ITU-R Recommendation, containing the RITs for 5G technologies, planned to be developed in 2019-20.

LTE has emerged as the dominating 4G technology by far.

# 3GPP Standardization
Process:
1.**Requirements**, where it is decided what is to be achieved by the specification.
2. **Architecture**, where the main building blocks and interfaces are decided.
3. **Detailed specifications**, where every interface is specified in detail.
4. **Testing and verification**, where the interface specifications are proven to work with real-life equipment.

Organization: 3GPP consists of three Technical Specifications Groups (TSGs).
